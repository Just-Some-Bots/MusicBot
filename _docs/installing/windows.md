MusicBot can be installed on Windows 7, 8, and 10 too, though it requires installing some programs on your computer first.

1. Install [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.7/python-3.8.7.exe).
2. During the setup, tick `Install launcher for all users (recommended)` and `Add Python 3.8 to PATH` when prompted.
3. Install [Git for Windows](http://gitforwindows.org/).
4. During the setup, tick `Git from the command line and also 3rd-party software`, `Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style endings`, and `Use MinTTY (the default terminal MSYS2)`.
5. Open Git Bash by right-clicking an empty space inside of a folder (e.g My Documents) and clicking `Git Bash here`.
6. Run `git clone https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot.git MusicBot -b review` in the command window that opens.

After doing that, a folder called `MusicBot` will appear in the folder you opened Git Bash in. [Configure]({{ site.baseurl }}/using/configuration) your bot, then run `update.bat` to update your dependencies, then `run.bat` to start the MusicBot.
