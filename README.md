# MusicBot

MusicBot is the original Discord music bot written for [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") 3.5+. It plays requested songs, from YouTube and other services, into a Discord server (or multiple servers) and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs, if configured to do so. The bot features a permissions system allowing owners to restrict commands to certain people. As well as playing songs, MusicBot is capable of streaming live media into a voice channel (experimental).

### How do I set it up?

To set up MusicBot, do not install the ZIP. While it is certainly possible, we won't provide support for it. Instead, use our official guides, [located here](https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot/wiki).

### Commands

There are many commands that can be used with the bot. Most notably, the `play <url>` command (preceded by your command prefix) will download, process, and play a song from YouTube or a similar site. A full list of commands are available [here](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/wiki/Commands-list "Commands list").

### Configuration

The main configuration file is `config/options.ini`, but is not included. Simply make a copy of `example_options.ini` and rename to `options.ini`. See `example_options.ini` for more information on how to configure it.

### Help

For some frequently asked questions, see [here](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/wiki/FAQ "Wiki"). If you require further help, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bots).

### Modification

As MusicBot uses the MIT license, you're welcome to modify it. However, we do not provide any support for this, or support for if something breaks as a result.
