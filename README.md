# RhinoBot: The music bot for Discord.

### What is this and what does it do?

RhinoBot is a very nifty Discord music bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It plays requested songs and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs.

### How do I set it up?

You can find detailed installation guides for your Operating System in the [wiki](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/wiki).

Once started, its good to go. If you have any errors, report them here or on my Discord and then restart the bot.
