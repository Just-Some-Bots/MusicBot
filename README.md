# RhinoBot: The music bot for Discord.

### What is this and what does it do?

RhinoBot is a Discord music bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It plays requested songs and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs.

### How do I set it up?

- You can find a tutorial on how to install it on Windows [here](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/wiki/Installation-guide-for-Windows-7-and-up "Windows instructions").
- You can find a tutorial on how to install it on Linux [here](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/wiki/Installation-guide-for-Ubuntu-14.04-and-other-versions "Linux instructions").

### Configuration options

All the configuration is done in 1 main options.txt file that you can find in the config folder. The explanation is [here](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/wiki/Configuration-file "Configuration").

### Commands

The bot is controlled by very easy commands that you enter in the discord chat. We have a list of commands on the [wiki](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot/wiki/Commands-list "Commands list").

### Sounds cool, How do I use it?
Simply download the bot, set the dependencies up, then run `runbot.bat`! (or `run.sh` on mac, `run.py` on linux)

It will let you know if it's connected and what channels are connected.

Once started, it's good to go. If you have any errors FIRST read the FAQ and if you are not able to solve your problem using the FAQ then you can report them on my discord server and then restart the bot. Is is always recommended to take screenshots so the developers can see errors.
