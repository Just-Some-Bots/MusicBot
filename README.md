### Hey, this is an edited version of the MusicBot. I suggest using the [Official Version](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot) unless you know how to use it and are competent (I won't be including any guides, figure it out).

All of these features are in a pull request to the main bot, so once/if they are implimented, this will be going away.

####Thanks to imayhaveborkedit for the original music bot, and @jaydenkieran for the logging features in the logging branch â™¥
