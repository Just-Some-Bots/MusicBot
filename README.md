### Hey, this is an edited version of the MusicBot. I suggest using the [Official Version](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot) unless you know how to use it and are competent (I won't be including any guides, figure it out).

All of these features are in a pull request to the main bot, so once/if they are implimented, this will be going away.

####Thanks to imayhaveborkedit for the original music bot, and @jaydenkieran for the logging features in the logging branch â™¥

###So what's different?

Both branches allow you to set a custom, static status. This prevents the status from always changing, and possibly showing info from links you don't want available on all servers (*cough NSFW cough*)

The logging branch allows you to set up logging in a Discord channel so that you can see any errors, restarts, and even song requests if you'd like.
