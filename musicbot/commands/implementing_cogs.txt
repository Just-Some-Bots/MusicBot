This text file serve as a guide for implementing a cog

    As you might already see in this folder, a cog is just a Python module but
wait, it's more than that.

    Modules are considered a cog if it instantiate cog_name variable, cog_name
shall hold string containing the cog name. This allows cogs to have characters
that are forbidden in file name and also prevent against accidentally loading
modules that aren't intended to be load.

    Cog need to hold commands, commands are asynchronous function with name
starting with 'cmd_'. For example, command 'help' is an asynchronous function
named 'cmd_help'. Every other functions are ignored.

    Command shall take first argument named 'bot'. The argument 'bot' always
receive a 'MusicBot' instance (implemented in bot.py). The instance received
is always an instance that invoke the command.

    After that, command will take arguments positionally (as user invoked
commands) except some special arguments as will be discussed in the below
block. Arguments got seperate based on whitespace.

    These are the list of special arguments and values they will get:
        'message':          message
        'channel':          message.channel
        'author':           message.author
        'guild':            message.guild
        'player':           await bot.get_player(message.channel)
        '_player':          bot.get_player_in(message.guild)
        'permissions':      user_permissions
        'user_mentions':    list(map(message.guild.get_member, message.raw_mentions))
        'channel_mentions': list(map(message.guild.get_channel, message.raw_channel_mentions))
        'voice_channel':    message.guild.me.voice.channel if message.guild.me.voice else None
        'leftover_args':    args
    where message is an instance of discord.Message (refer to discord.py
documentation). args is string containing arguments passed from user seperated
with whitespaces.

    Commands can be called across cogs (currently not functions). For safety
against dynamically loading and unloading modules so your cog won't get
unloaded when it is other cog's fault, commands should be called via callcmd
function, which can be found in cogsmanager module. Supply first argument as
command name and the rest argument as you would normally call. Noted that the
function might raise an exceptions. CogError exception when command is not
found. For commands in the same cog there is no need to call callcmd as the
entire cog will be unloaded anyway if non-MusicBot exception raised. For
example of how to call command from other cog, see intercog_example.py.

That's it!
