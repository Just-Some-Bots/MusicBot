Issue 1613 improvement on the help command
1. !help in the channel with the bot as a person with owner permissions
    - view all 31 commands available to you formatted in an easy-to-read manner with bold numbers and underlined commands

2. !help in the channel with the bot as a person with non-owner permissions
    - view all basic commmands available to you formatted in an easy-to-read manner with bold numbers and underlined commands

(the !help command can be executed on specific commmands but i did not touch that part of the function)

Group Issue switching playlist
(These tests must be executed while in the channel with the bot)
1. !plswitch filename given an existing file in the config folder with youtube urls
   - the player should stop and swap to that playlist
   - the swap can be proved successful if you run the !np commmand and you see it playing the first song on your list.

2. !plswitch filename with an non-existent filename or an empty txt file in the config folder
   - the player will not stop your current playlist
   - the player will print out an error message saying that the playlist is empty or non-existent

3. !plswitch filename given a file with non-youtube links or some other garbage text
   - the player will not stop your current playlist
   - an error message will print in discord saying that it failed to extract information from the url
