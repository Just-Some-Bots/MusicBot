MusicBot is the original Discord music bot written for Python 3 using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). For a quick overview of what the bot is, and for the code history, see the [repository](https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot) for it. This documentation serves as an information source for how to install, configure, use, and troubleshoot the bot.
