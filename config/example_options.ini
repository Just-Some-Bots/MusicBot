# This is the configuration file for MusicBot. You need to edit this file
# to setup the bot. Do not edit this file using Notepad as it ruins the
# formatting - use Notepad++ or a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

# For help, see: https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/

# To get IDs, enable Developer Mode (Options -> Settings -> Appearance)
# on Discord and then right-click the person/channel you want to get the
# channel of, then click 'Copy ID'. You can also use the 'listids' command.

; HOW TO GET VARIOUS IDS:
; http://i.imgur.com/GhKpBMQ.gif
; Enable developer mode (options, settings, appearance), right click the object you want the id of, and click Copy ID
; This works for basically everything you would want the id of (channels and users).  For roles you have to right click a role mention.


[Credentials]
# This is your Discord bot account token.
# Find your bot's token here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/
# Create a new application, with no redirect URI or boxes ticked.
# Then click 'Create Bot User' on the application page and copy the token here.

# The bot supports converting Spotify links and URIs to YouTube videos and
# playing them. The bot offers 2 methods to use this feature:
# 1. (Recommended) You can fill in the two options below with the credentials,
#    following these instructions: https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/using/spotify/
# 2. The bot will try to generate it's own credentials and communicate with
#    Spotify's API using them. This will be automatically enabled when
#    the two options below are left empty.

Spotify_ClientSecret =

[Permissions]
# This option determines which user has full permissions and control of the bot.
# You can only set one owner, but you can use permissions.ini to give other
# users access to more commands.
# Setting this option to 'auto' will set the owner of the bot to the person who
# created the bot application, which is usually what you want. Else, change it
# to another user's ID.
OwnerID = auto

# This option determines which users have access to developer-only commands.
# Developer only commands are very dangerous and may break your bot if used
# incorrectly, so it's highly recommended that you ignore this option unless you
# are familiar with Python code.
DevIDs =

# This option determines if the bot should respond to other any other bots
# put bot ID's here seperated with spaces
# Any id you put here the bot WILL respond to.

[Chat]
# Determines the prefix that must be used before commands in the Discord chat.
# e.g if you set this to *, the play command would be triggered using *play.
CommandPrefix = !

# Restricts the bot to only listening to certain text channels. To use this, add
# the IDs of the text channels you would like the bot to listen to, seperated by
# a space.
BindToChannels =

# Changes the behavior of BindToChannels. Normally any messages sent to a channel not in
# BindToChannels will be ignored. This option allows servers that do not have any bound
# channels while other server have some defined to still use commands in any channel with
# the Music Bot. Setting this to yes when there are no bound channels does nothing.
AllowUnboundServers = no

# Allows the bot to automatically join servers on startup. To use this, add the IDs
# of the voice channels you would like the bot to join on startup, seperated by a
# space. Each server can have one channel. If this option and AutoSummon are
# enabled, this option will take priority.
AutojoinChannels =

# Disable now playing messages for entries automatically added by the bot, via the autoplaylist.
DisableNowPlayingAutomatic = no

# For now playing messages that are unaffected by DMNowPlaying and DisableNowPlayingAutomatic,
# determine which channels the bot is going to output now playing messages to. If this is not
# specified for a server, now playing message for manually added entries will be sent in the same
# channel that users used the command to add that entry, and now playing messages for automatically 
# added entries will be sent to the same channel that the last now playing message was sent to if
# this is not specified for a server if possible. Specifying more than one channel for a server
# forces the bot to pick only one channel from the list to send messages to.
