; The bot must be restarted for edits to take effect, but a reload command will be created in the future.
; Currently the bot does not overwrite any settings, but this may change in a future update.

; Change this if you don't want commands to trigger another bot
; Example:
;	CommandPrefix = *
; This means the commands you use in chat are *play, *skip, etc.  This explanation exists because it seems no one knows what "prefix" means.
; You do not list commands here.  You do not put "CommandPrefix = *play *queue *np *skip *clear..." etc.  R e a d i n g   c o m p r e h e n s i o n.

; Restrict the bot to only listen to certain text channels.  Uncomment (remove the ; at the start of the line) and add channel IDs to enable.
; An id looks like this number: 41771983423143930
; To get a channel id, enable Developer Mode in discord (settings, appearance), right click a channel, and click Copy ID.
; Example: BindToChannels = 41000000000000005 41000000000000007
; (Don't use these ids, they won't work)
