# This is the configuration file for MusicBot. You need to edit this file
# to setup the bot. Do not edit this file using Notepad as it ruins the
# formatting - use Notepad++ or a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

# For help, see: https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/

# To get IDs, enable Developer Mode (Options -> Settings -> Appearance)
# on Discord and then right-click the person/channel you want to get the
# channel of, then click 'Copy ID'. You can also use the 'listids' command.

; Enable developer mode (options, settings, appearance), right click the object you want the id of, and click Copy ID
; This works for basically everything you would want the id of (channels and users).  For roles you have to right click a role mention.

# created the bot application, which is usually what you want. Else, change it
# to another user's ID.
