; Basics:
; - Semicolons are comment characters, sections are permissions groups.
; - Options with a semicolon before them will be ignored.
; - Add whatever permissions you want, but always have at least one.
; - Never have an options without a value, i.e. "CommandBlacklist = "
; - [Default] is a special section.  Any user that doesn't get assigned to a group via role or UserList gets assigned to this group.
;
;
; Option info:
;
;    [Groupname]
;    This is the name of the group.  Just name it something appropriate for its permissions.
;
;    CommandWhitelist = command1 command2
;    List of commands users are allowed to use, separated by spaces.  Don't include the prefix, i.e. !  Overrides CommandBlacklist if set.
;
;    CommandBlacklist = command1 command2
;    List if commands users are not allowed to use.  You don't need to use both
;    whitelist and blacklist since blacklist gets overridden.  Just pick one.
;
;    IgnoreNonVoice = command1 command2
;    List of commands that the user is required to be in the same voice channel as the bot to use.
;    For example, if you don't want the user to be able to voteskip songs while not in the voice channel, add skip to this option.
;
;    GrantToRoles = 111222333444555 999888777000111
;    List of ids to automatically grant this group to.  To get the id of a role, use the listroles command.
;
;    UserList = 21343341324 321432413214321
;    List of user ids to grant this group to.  This option overrides the role granted by the GrantToRoles option.
;
;    MaxSongLength = 600
;    Maximum length of a song in seconds.  Note: This won't always work if the song data doesn't have duration listed.
;    This doesn't happen often, but youtube, soundcloud, etc work fine though.  This will be fixed in a future update.
;    A value of 0 means unlimited.
;
;    MaxSongs = 5
;    Maximum number of songs a user is allowed to queue. A value of 0 means unlimited.
;
;    AllowPlaylists = yes
;    Whether of not the user is allowed to queue entire playlists.
