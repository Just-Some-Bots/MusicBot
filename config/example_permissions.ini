; Basics:
; - Lines starting with semicolons (;) are comments, and are ignored.
; - Words in square brackets [ ] are permission group names.
; - Group names must be unique, and cannot be duplicated.
; - Each group must have at least one permission option defined.
; - [Default] is a reserved section. Users without a specific group assigned will use it.
; - [Owner (auto)] is a reserved section that cannot be edited.
; 
; Available Options:
;  CommandWhitelist = 
;     List of command names allowed for use, separated by spaces.
;     Sub-command access can be controlled by adding _ and the sub-command name.
;     That is `config_set` grants only the `set` sub-command of the config command.
;     This option overrides CommandBlacklist if set.
; 
;  CommandBlacklist = 
;     List of command names denied from use, separated by spaces.

; 
;  AdvancedCommandLists = no

; 
;  IgnoreNonVoice = 
;     List of command names that can only be used while in the same voice channel as MusicBot.
;     Some commands will always require the user to be in voice, regardless of this list.
;     Command names should be separated by spaces.

;     This option is ignored if UserList is set.

; 
;  Extractors = youtube, Bandcamp, spotify:musicbot, soundcloud, generic
;     Specify yt-dlp extractor names, separated by spaces, that are allowed to be used.
;     When empty, hard-coded defaults are used. The defaults are displayed above, but may change between versions.
