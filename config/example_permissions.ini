; - Words in square brackets [ ] are permission group names.
; - Group names must be unique, and cannot be duplicated.
; - Each group must have at least one permission option defined.
; - [Default] is a reserved section. Users without a specific group assigned will use it.
; - [Owner (auto)] is a reserved section that cannot be removed, used by the Owner user.
; 
; Available Options:
;  CommandWhitelist = 
;     List of command names allowed for use, separated by spaces.
;     Sub-command access can be controlled by adding _ and the sub-command name.
