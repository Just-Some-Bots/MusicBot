## MusicBot  

MusicBot itself collects no user information or telemetry.  
When checking for updates, MusicBot will access GitHub.com to download updates and related information from the repository.  
GitHub may provide members of Just Some Bots with basic analytics regarding the number of downloads, forks, and various contributions from users and collaborators.  
In normal operations, MusicBot will regularly commmunicate with the Discord API and other services (such as Spotify API, or services available through Yt-dlp) as frequently as requested by a user command.  
MusicBot attempts to provide only required information to any services it may connect to. 
However, MusicBot cannot control the processes of third-party services and thus encourages users to review the terms and policies of any services to which MusicBot connects before making use of those services.
