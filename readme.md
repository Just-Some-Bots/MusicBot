The MusicBot docs use [Aviator](https://github.com/CloudCannon/aviator-jekyll-template) as a theme.

## Develop

Aviator was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.1.6, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
