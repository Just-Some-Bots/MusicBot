For example, with the following configuration file yt\-dlp will always
extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos
under \f[C]YouTube\f[] directory in your home directory:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ Lines\ starting\ with\ #\ are\ comments

#\ Always\ extract\ audio
\-x

#\ Do\ not\ copy\ the\ mtime
\-\-no\-mtime

#\ Use\ this\ proxy
\-\-proxy\ 127.0.0.1:3128

#\ Save\ all\ videos\ under\ YouTube\ directory\ in\ your\ home\ directory
\-o\ ~/YouTube/%(title)s.%(ext)s
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that options in configuration file are just the same options aka
switches used in regular command line calls; thus there \f[B]must be no
whitespace\f[] after \f[C]\-\f[] or \f[C]\-\-\f[], e.g.
\f[C]\-o\f[] or \f[C]\-\-proxy\f[] but not \f[C]\-\ o\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-\ proxy\f[].
.PP
You can use \f[C]\-\-ignore\-config\f[] if you want to disable all
configuration files for a particular yt\-dlp run.
If \f[C]\-\-ignore\-config\f[] is found inside any configuration file,
no further configuration will be loaded.
For example, having the option in the portable configuration file
prevents loading of home, user, and system configurations.
Additionally, (for backward compatibility) if
\f[C]\-\-ignore\-config\f[] is found inside the system configuration
file, the user configuration is not loaded.
.SS Config file encoding
.PP
The config files are decoded according to the UTF BOM if present, and in
the encoding from system locale otherwise.
.PP
If you want your file to be decoded differently, add
\f[C]#\ coding:\ ENCODING\f[] to the beginning of the file (e.g.
\f[C]#\ coding:\ shift\-jis\f[]).
There must be no characters before that, even spaces or BOM.
.SS Authentication with \f[C]\&.netrc\f[] file
.PP
You may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for
extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password
with \f[C]\-\-username\f[] and \f[C]\-\-password\f[]) in order not to
pass credentials as command line arguments on every yt\-dlp execution
and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history.
You can achieve this using a \f[C]\&.netrc\f[]
file (https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info) on a per extractor
basis.
For that you will need to create a \f[C]\&.netrc\f[] file in
\f[C]\-\-netrc\-location\f[] and restrict permissions to read/write by
only you:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch\ $HOME/.netrc
chmod\ a\-rwx,u+rw\ $HOME/.netrc
\f[]
.fi
.PP
After that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following
format, where \f[I]extractor\f[] is the name of the extractor in
lowercase:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
machine\ <extractor>\ login\ <username>\ password\ <password>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
machine\ youtube\ login\ myaccount\@gmail.com\ password\ my_youtube_password
machine\ twitch\ login\ my_twitch_account_name\ password\ my_twitch_password
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To activate authentication with the \f[C]\&.netrc\f[] file you should
pass \f[C]\-\-netrc\f[] to yt\-dlp or place it in the configuration
file (#configuration).
.PP
The default location of the .netrc file is \f[C]$HOME\f[] (\f[C]~\f[])
in UNIX.
On Windows, it is \f[C]%HOME%\f[] if present, \f[C]%USERPROFILE%\f[]
(generally \f[C]C:\\Users\\<user\ name>\f[]) or
\f[C]%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\f[]
.SH OUTPUT TEMPLATE
.PP
The \f[C]\-o\f[] option is used to indicate a template for the output
file names while \f[C]\-P\f[] option is used to specify the path each
type of file should be saved to.
.PP
The simplest usage of \f[C]\-o\f[] is not to set any template arguments
when downloading a single file, like in
\f[C]yt\-dlp\ \-o\ funny_video.flv\ "https://some/video"\f[]
(hard\-coding file extension like this is \f[I]not\f[] recommended and
could break some post\-processing).
.PP
It may however also contain special sequences that will be replaced when
downloading each video.
The special sequences may be formatted according to Python string
formatting
operations (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting).
For example, \f[C]%(NAME)s\f[] or \f[C]%(NAME)05d\f[].
To clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses,
followed by formatting operations.
.PP
The field names themselves (the part inside the parenthesis) can also
have some special formatting:
.IP "1." 3
\f[B]Object traversal\f[]: The dictionaries and lists available in
metadata can be traversed by using a \f[C]\&.\f[] (dot) separator.
You can also do python slicing using \f[C]:\f[].
Eg: \f[C]%(tags.0)s\f[], \f[C]%(subtitles.en.\-1.ext)s\f[],
\f[C]%(id.3:7:\-1)s\f[], \f[C]%(formats.:.format_id)s\f[].
\f[C]%()s\f[] refers to the entire infodict.
Note that all the fields that become available using this method are not
listed below.
Use \f[C]\-j\f[] to see such fields
.IP "2." 3
\f[B]Addition\f[]: Addition and subtraction of numeric fields can be
done using \f[C]+\f[] and \f[C]\-\f[] respectively.
Eg: \f[C]%(playlist_index+10)03d\f[],
\f[C]%(n_entries+1\-playlist_index)d\f[]
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]Date/time Formatting\f[]: Date/time fields can be formatted
according to strftime
formatting (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes)
by specifying it separated from the field name using a \f[C]>\f[].
Eg: \f[C]%(duration>%H\-%M\-%S)s\f[],
\f[C]%(upload_date>%Y\-%m\-%d)s\f[], \f[C]%(epoch\-3600>%H\-%M\-%S)s\f[]
.IP "4." 3
\f[B]Alternatives\f[]: Alternate fields can be specified separated with
a \f[C],\f[].
Eg: \f[C]%(release_date>%Y,upload_date>%Y|Unknown)s\f[]
.IP "5." 3
\f[B]Replacement\f[]: A replacement value can specified using a
\f[C]&\f[] separator.
If the field is \f[I]not\f[] empty, this replacement value will be used
instead of the actual field content.
This is done after alternate fields are considered; thus the replacement
is used if \f[I]any\f[] of the alternative fields is \f[I]not\f[] empty.
.IP "6." 3
\f[B]Default\f[]: A literal default value can be specified for when the
field is empty using a \f[C]|\f[] separator.
This overrides \f[C]\-\-output\-na\-template\f[].
Eg: \f[C]%(uploader|Unknown)s\f[]
.IP "7." 3
\f[B]More Conversions\f[]: In addition to the normal format types
\f[C]diouxXeEfFgGcrs\f[], yt\-dlp additionally supports converting to
\f[C]B\f[] = \f[B]B\f[]ytes, \f[C]j\f[] = \f[B]j\f[]son (flag \f[C]#\f[]
for pretty\-printing), \f[C]h\f[] = HTML escaping, \f[C]l\f[] = a comma
separated \f[B]l\f[]ist (flag \f[C]#\f[] for \f[C]\\n\f[]
newline\-separated), \f[C]q\f[] = a string \f[B]q\f[]uoted for the
terminal (flag \f[C]#\f[] to split a list into different arguments),
\f[C]D\f[] = add \f[B]D\f[]ecimal suffixes (Eg: 10M) (flag \f[C]#\f[] to
use 1024 as factor), and \f[C]S\f[] = \f[B]S\f[]anitize as filename
(flag \f[C]#\f[] for restricted)
.IP "8." 3
\f[B]Unicode normalization\f[]: The format type \f[C]U\f[] can be used
for NFC unicode
normalization (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize).
The alternate form flag (\f[C]#\f[]) changes the normalization to NFD
and the conversion flag \f[C]+\f[] can be used for NFKC/NFKD
compatibility equivalence normalization.
Eg: \f[C]%(title)+.100U\f[] is NFKC
.PP
To summarize, the general syntax for a field is:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
%(name[.keys][addition][>strf][,alternate][&replacement][|default])[flags][width][.precision][length]type
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Additionally, you can set different output templates for the various
metadata files separately from the general output template by specifying
the type of file followed by the template separated by a colon
\f[C]:\f[].
The different file types supported are \f[C]subtitle\f[],
\f[C]thumbnail\f[], \f[C]description\f[], \f[C]annotation\f[]
(deprecated), \f[C]infojson\f[], \f[C]link\f[], \f[C]pl_thumbnail\f[],
\f[C]pl_description\f[], \f[C]pl_infojson\f[], \f[C]chapter\f[],
\f[C]pl_video\f[].
For example,
\f[C]\-o\ "%(title)s.%(ext)s"\ \-o\ "thumbnail:%(title)s\\%(title)s.%(ext)s"\f[]
will put the thumbnails in a folder with the same name as the video.
If any of the templates is empty, that type of file will not be written.
Eg: \f[C]\-\-write\-thumbnail\ \-o\ "thumbnail:"\f[] will write
thumbnails only for playlists and not for video.

Each aforementioned sequence when referenced in an output template will
be replaced by the actual value corresponding to the sequence name.
For example for \f[C]\-o\ %(title)s\-%(id)s.%(ext)s\f[] and an mp4 video
with title \f[C]yt\-dlp\ test\ video\f[] and id \f[C]BaW_jenozKc\f[],
this will result in a \f[C]yt\-dlp\ test\ video\-BaW_jenozKc.mp4\f[]
file created in the current directory.
.PP
Note that some of the sequences are not guaranteed to be present since
they depend on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor.
Such sequences will be replaced with placeholder value provided with
\f[C]\-\-output\-na\-placeholder\f[] (\f[C]NA\f[] by default).
.PP
\f[B]Tip\f[]: Look at the \f[C]\-j\f[] output to identify which fields
are available for the particular URL
.PP
For numeric sequences you can use numeric related
formatting (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting),
for example, \f[C]%(view_count)05d\f[] will result in a string with view
count padded with zeros up to 5 characters, like in \f[C]00042\f[].
.PP
Output templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g.
\f[C]\-o\ "%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s\ \-\ %(title)s.%(ext)s"\f[]
which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding
to this path template.
Any missing directory will be automatically created for you.
.PP
To use percent literals in an output template use \f[C]%%\f[].
To output to stdout use \f[C]\-o\ \-\f[].
.PP
The current default template is \f[C]%(title)s\ [%(id)s].%(ext)s\f[].
.PP
In some cases, you don\[aq]t want special characters such as 中, spaces,
or &, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a Windows
system or the filename through an 8bit\-unsafe channel.
In these cases, add the \f[C]\-\-restrict\-filenames\f[] flag to get a
shorter title.

.SH FORMAT SELECTION
.PP
By default, yt\-dlp tries to download the best available quality if you
\f[B]don\[aq]t\f[] pass any options.
This is generally equivalent to using
\f[C]\-f\ bestvideo*+bestaudio/best\f[].
However, if multiple audiostreams is enabled
(\f[C]\-\-audio\-multistreams\f[]), the default format changes to
\f[C]\-f\ bestvideo+bestaudio/best\f[].
Similarly, if ffmpeg is unavailable, or if you use yt\-dlp to stream to
\f[C]stdout\f[] (\f[C]\-o\ \-\f[]), the default becomes
\f[C]\-f\ best/bestvideo+bestaudio\f[].
.PP
\f[B]Deprecation warning\f[]: Latest versions of yt\-dlp can stream
multiple formats to the stdout simultaneously using ffmpeg.
So, in future versions, the default for this will be set to
\f[C]\-f\ bv*+ba/b\f[] similar to normal downloads.
If you want to preserve the \f[C]\-f\ b/bv+ba\f[] setting, it is
recommended to explicitly specify it in the configuration options.
.PP
The general syntax for format selection is \f[C]\-f\ FORMAT\f[] (or
\f[C]\-\-format\ FORMAT\f[]) where \f[C]FORMAT\f[] is a \f[I]selector
expression\f[], i.e.
an expression that describes format or formats you would like to
download.
.PP
The simplest case is requesting a specific format, for example with
\f[C]\-f\ 22\f[] you can download the format with format code equal to
22.
You can get the list of available format codes for particular video
using \f[C]\-\-list\-formats\f[] or \f[C]\-F\f[].
Note that these format codes are extractor specific.
.PP
You can also use a file extension (currently \f[C]3gp\f[], \f[C]aac\f[],
\f[C]flv\f[], \f[C]m4a\f[], \f[C]mp3\f[], \f[C]mp4\f[], \f[C]ogg\f[],
\f[C]wav\f[], \f[C]webm\f[] are supported) to download the best quality
format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g.
\f[C]\-f\ webm\f[] will download the best quality format with the
\f[C]webm\f[] extension served as a single file.
.PP
You can use \f[C]\-f\ \-\f[] to interactively provide the format
selector \f[I]for each video\f[]
.PP
You can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:
.IP \[bu] 2

.PP
For example, to download the worst quality video\-only format you can
use \f[C]\-f\ worstvideo\f[].
It is however recommended not to use \f[C]worst\f[] and related options.
When your format selector is \f[C]worst\f[], the format which is worst
in all respects is selected.
Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest
filesize instead.
So it is generally better to use \f[C]\-S\ +size\f[] or more rigorously,
\f[C]\-S\ +size,+br,+res,+fps\f[] instead of \f[C]\-f\ worst\f[].
See sorting formats (#sorting-formats) for more details.
.PP
You can select the n\[aq]th best format of a type by using
\f[C]best<type>.<n>\f[].
For example, \f[C]best.2\f[] will select the 2nd best combined format.
Similarly, \f[C]bv*.3\f[] will select the 3rd best format that contains
a video stream.
.PP
If you want to download multiple videos and they don\[aq]t have the same
formats available, you can specify the order of preference using
slashes.
Note that formats on the left hand side are preferred, for example
\f[C]\-f\ 22/17/18\f[] will download format 22 if it\[aq]s available,
otherwise it will download format 17 if it\[aq]s available, otherwise it
will download format 18 if it\[aq]s available, otherwise it will
complain that no suitable formats are available for download.
.PP
If you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as
a separator, e.g.
\f[C]\-f\ 22,17,18\f[] will download all these three formats, of course
if they are available.
Or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature:
\f[C]\-f\ 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio\f[].
.PP
You can merge the video and audio of multiple formats into a single file
using \f[C]\-f\ <format1>+<format2>+...\f[] (requires ffmpeg installed),
for example \f[C]\-f\ bestvideo+bestaudio\f[] will download the best
video\-only format, the best audio\-only format and mux them together
with ffmpeg.
.PP
\f[B]Deprecation warning\f[]: Since the \f[I]below\f[] described
behavior is complex and counter\-intuitive, this will be removed and
multistreams will be enabled by default in the future.
A new operator will be instead added to limit formats to single
audio/video
.PP
Unless \f[C]\-\-video\-multistreams\f[] is used, all formats with a
video stream except the first one are ignored.
Similarly, unless \f[C]\-\-audio\-multistreams\f[] is used, all formats
with an audio stream except the first one are ignored.
For example,
\f[C]\-f\ bestvideo+best+bestaudio\ \-\-video\-multistreams\ \-\-audio\-multistreams\f[]
will download and merge all 3 given formats.
The resulting file will have 2 video streams and 2 audio streams.
But \f[C]\-f\ bestvideo+best+bestaudio\ \-\-no\-video\-multistreams\f[]
will download and merge only \f[C]bestvideo\f[] and \f[C]bestaudio\f[].
\f[C]best\f[] is ignored since another format containing a video stream
(\f[C]bestvideo\f[]) has already been selected.
The order of the formats is therefore important.
\f[C]\-f\ best+bestaudio\ \-\-no\-audio\-multistreams\f[] will download
and merge both formats while
\f[C]\-f\ bestaudio+best\ \-\-no\-audio\-multistreams\f[] will ignore
\f[C]best\f[] and download only \f[C]bestaudio\f[].
.SS Filtering Formats
.PP
You can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in
brackets, as in \f[C]\-f\ "best[height=720]"\f[] (or
\f[C]\-f\ "[filesize>10M]"\f[]).
.PP
The following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons
\f[C]<\f[], \f[C]<=\f[], \f[C]>\f[], \f[C]>=\f[], \f[C]=\f[] (equals),
\f[C]!=\f[] (not equals):
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]filesize\f[]: The number of bytes, if known in advance
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]width\f[]: Width of the video, if known
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]height\f[]: Height of the video, if known
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]tbr\f[]: Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit/s
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]abr\f[]: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]vbr\f[]: Average video bitrate in KBit/s
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]asr\f[]: Audio sampling rate in Hertz
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]fps\f[]: Frame rate
.PP
Also filtering work for comparisons \f[C]=\f[] (equals), \f[C]^=\f[]
(starts with), \f[C]$=\f[] (ends with), \f[C]*=\f[] (contains),
\f[C]~=\f[] (matches regex) and following string meta fields:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]ext\f[]: File extension
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]acodec\f[]: Name of the audio codec in use
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]vcodec\f[]: Name of the video codec in use
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]container\f[]: Name of the container format
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]protocol\f[]: The protocol that will be used for the actual
download, lower\-case (\f[C]http\f[], \f[C]https\f[], \f[C]rtsp\f[],
\f[C]rtmp\f[], \f[C]rtmpe\f[], \f[C]mms\f[], \f[C]f4m\f[], \f[C]ism\f[],
\f[C]http_dash_segments\f[], \f[C]m3u8\f[], or \f[C]m3u8_native\f[])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]format_id\f[]: A short description of the format
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]language\f[]: Language code
.PP
Any string comparison may be prefixed with negation \f[C]!\f[] in order
to produce an opposite comparison, e.g.
\f[C]!*=\f[] (does not contain).
The comparand of a string comparison needs to be quoted with either
double or single quotes if it contains spaces or special characters
other than \f[C]\&._\-\f[].
.PP
Note that none of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be
present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by particular
extractor, i.e.
the metadata offered by the website.
Any other field made available by the extractor can also be used for
filtering.
.PP
Formats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a
question mark (\f[C]?\f[]) after the operator.
You can combine format filters, so
\f[C]\-f\ "[height<=?720][tbr>500]"\f[] selects up to 720p videos (or
videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500
KBit/s.
You can also use the filters with \f[C]all\f[] to download all formats
that satisfy the filter.
For example, \f[C]\-f\ "all[vcodec=none]"\f[] selects all audio\-only
formats.
.PP
Format selectors can also be grouped using parentheses, for example if
you want to download the best pre\-merged mp4 and webm formats with a
height lower than 480 you can use
\f[C]\-f\ "(mp4,webm)[height<480]"\f[].
.SS Sorting Formats
.PP
You can change the criteria for being considered the \f[C]best\f[] by
using \f[C]\-S\f[] (\f[C]\-\-format\-sort\f[]).
The general format for this is
\f[C]\-\-format\-sort\ field1,field2...\f[].
.PP
The available fields are:

.PP
\f[B]Deprecation warning\f[]: Many of these fields have (currently
undocumented) aliases, that may be removed in a future version.
It is recommended to use only the documented field names.
.PP
All fields, unless specified otherwise, are sorted in descending order.
To reverse this, prefix the field with a \f[C]+\f[].
Eg: \f[C]+res\f[] prefers format with the smallest resolution.
Additionally, you can suffix a preferred value for the fields, separated
by a \f[C]:\f[].
Eg: \f[C]res:720\f[] prefers larger videos, but no larger than 720p and
the smallest video if there are no videos less than 720p.
For \f[C]codec\f[] and \f[C]ext\f[], you can provide two preferred
values, the first for video and the second for audio.
Eg: \f[C]+codec:avc:m4a\f[] (equivalent to
\f[C]+vcodec:avc,+acodec:m4a\f[]) sets the video codec preference to
\f[C]h264\f[] > \f[C]h265\f[] > \f[C]vp9\f[] > \f[C]vp9.2\f[] >
\f[C]av01\f[] > \f[C]vp8\f[] > \f[C]h263\f[] > \f[C]theora\f[] and audio
codec preference to \f[C]mp4a\f[] > \f[C]aac\f[] > \f[C]vorbis\f[] >
\f[C]opus\f[] > \f[C]mp3\f[] > \f[C]ac3\f[] > \f[C]dts\f[].
You can also make the sorting prefer the nearest values to the provided
by using \f[C]~\f[] as the delimiter.
Eg: \f[C]filesize~1G\f[] prefers the format with filesize closest to 1
GiB.
.PP
The fields \f[C]hasvid\f[] and \f[C]ie_pref\f[] are always given highest
priority in sorting, irrespective of the user\-defined order.
This behaviour can be changed by using \f[C]\-\-format\-sort\-force\f[].
Apart from these, the default order used is:
\f[C]lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,codec:vp9.2,size,br,asr,proto,ext,hasaud,source,id\f[].
The extractors may override this default order, but they cannot override
the user\-provided order.
.PP
Note that the default has \f[C]codec:vp9.2\f[]; i.e.
\f[C]av1\f[] is not preferred.
Similarly, the default for hdr is \f[C]hdr:12\f[]; i.e.
dolby vision is not preferred.
These choices are made since DV and AV1 formats are not yet fully
compatible with most devices.
This may be changed in the future as more devices become capable of
smoothly playing back these formats.
.PP
If your format selector is \f[C]worst\f[], the last item is selected
after sorting.
This means it will select the format that is worst in all respects.
Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest
filesize instead.
So it is generally better to use
\f[C]\-f\ best\ \-S\ +size,+br,+res,+fps\f[].
.PP
\f[B]Tip\f[]: You can use the \f[C]\-v\ \-F\f[] to see how the formats
have been sorted (worst to best).

\f[C]\-\-parse\-metadata\f[] and \f[C]\-\-replace\-in\-metadata\f[]
.PP
\f[C]\-\-replace\-in\-metadata\ FIELDS\ REGEX\ REPLACE\f[] is used to

template (#output-template) and will also affect the media file\[aq]s
metadata added when using \f[C]\-\-add\-metadata\f[].
.PP
This option also has a few special uses:
.IP \[bu] 2
You can download an additional URL based on the metadata of the
currently downloaded video.
To do this, set the field \f[C]additional_urls\f[] to the URL that you
want to download.
Eg:
\f[C]\-\-parse\-metadata\ "description:(?P<additional_urls>https?://www\\.vimeo\\.com/\\d+)\f[]
will download the first vimeo video found in the description
.IP \[bu] 2
You can use this to change the metadata that is embedded in the media
file.
To do this, set the value of the corresponding field with a
\f[C]meta_\f[] prefix.
For example, any value you set to \f[C]meta_description\f[] field will
be added to the \f[C]description\f[] field in the file.
For example, you can use this to set a different "description" and
"synopsis".
To modify the metadata of individual streams, use the \f[C]meta<n>_\f[]
prefix (Eg: \f[C]meta1_language\f[]).
Any value set to the \f[C]meta_\f[] field will overwrite all default
values.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]: Metadata modification happens before format selection,
post\-extraction and other post\-processing operations.
Some fields may be added or changed during these steps, overriding your
changes.

For reference, these are the fields yt\-dlp adds by default to the file

You can also fork the project on github and run your fork\[aq]s build
workflow (.github/workflows/build.yml) to automatically build a full
release
.SH PLUGINS
.PP
Plugins are loaded from
\f[C]<root\-dir>/ytdlp_plugins/<type>/__init__.py\f[]; where
\f[C]<root\-dir>\f[] is the directory of the binary
(\f[C]<root\-dir>/yt\-dlp\f[]), or the root directory of the module if
you are running directly from source\-code
(\f[C]<root\ dir>/yt_dlp/__main__.py\f[]).
Plugins are currently not supported for the \f[C]pip\f[] version
.PP
Plugins can be of \f[C]<type>\f[]s \f[C]extractor\f[] or
\f[C]postprocessor\f[].
Extractor plugins do not need to be enabled from the CLI and are
automatically invoked when the input URL is suitable for it.
Postprocessor plugins can be invoked using
\f[C]\-\-use\-postprocessor\ NAME\f[].
.PP
See <ytdlp_plugins> for example plugins.
.PP
Note that \f[B]all\f[] plugins are imported even if not invoked, and
that \f[B]there are no checks\f[] performed on plugin code.
Use plugins at your own risk and only if you trust the code
.PP
If you are a plugin author, add
ytdlp\-plugins (https://github.com/topics/ytdlp-plugins) as a topic to
your repository for discoverability
.SH EMBEDDING YT\-DLP
.PP
yt\-dlp makes the best effort to be a good command\-line program, and
thus should be callable from any programming language.
.PP
Your program should avoid parsing the normal stdout since they may
change in future versions.
Instead they should use options such as \f[C]\-J\f[],
\f[C]\-\-print\f[], \f[C]\-\-progress\-template\f[], \f[C]\-\-exec\f[]
etc to create console output that you can reliably reproduce and parse.
.PP
From a Python program, you can embed yt\-dlp in a more powerful fashion,
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
from\ yt_dlp\ import\ YoutubeDL

URLS\ =\ [\[aq]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc\[aq]]
with\ YoutubeDL()\ as\ ydl:
\ \ \ \ ydl.download(URLS)
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Most likely, you\[aq]ll want to use various options.
For a list of options available, have a look at
\f[C]yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py\f[] (yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py#L180).
.PP
\f[B]Tip\f[]: If you are porting your code from youtube\-dl to yt\-dlp,
one important point to look out for is that we do not guarantee the
return value of \f[C]YoutubeDL.extract_info\f[] to be json serializable,
or even be a dictionary.
It will be dictionary\-like, but if you want to ensure it is a
serializable dictionary, pass it through
\f[C]YoutubeDL.sanitize_info\f[] as shown in the example
below (#extracting-information)

.SS Differences in default behavior
.PP
Some of yt\-dlp\[aq]s default options are different from that of
youtube\-dl and youtube\-dlc:
.IP \[bu] 2
The options \f[C]\-\-auto\-number\f[] (\f[C]\-A\f[]), \f[C]\-\-title\f[]
(\f[C]\-t\f[]) and \f[C]\-\-literal\f[] (\f[C]\-l\f[]), no longer work.
See removed options (#Removed) for details
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]avconv\f[] is not supported as an alternative to \f[C]ffmpeg\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
yt\-dlp stores config files in slightly different locations to
youtube\-dl.
See configuration (#configuration) for a list of correct locations
.IP \[bu] 2
The default output template (#output-template) is
\f[C]%(title)s\ [%(id)s].%(ext)s\f[].
There is no real reason for this change.
This was changed before yt\-dlp was ever made public and now there are
no plans to change it back to \f[C]%(title)s\-%(id)s.%(ext)s\f[].
Instead, you may use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ filename\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
The default format sorting (#sorting-formats) is different from
youtube\-dl and prefers higher resolution and better codecs rather than
higher bitrates.
You can use the \f[C]\-\-format\-sort\f[] option to change this to any
order you prefer, or use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ format\-sort\f[] to
use youtube\-dl\[aq]s sorting order
.IP \[bu] 2
The default format selector is \f[C]bv*+ba/b\f[].
This means that if a combined video + audio format that is better than
the best video\-only format is found, the former will be preferred.
Use \f[C]\-f\ bv+ba/b\f[] or \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ format\-spec\f[]
to revert this
.IP \[bu] 2
Unlike youtube\-dlc, yt\-dlp does not allow merging multiple audio/video
streams into one file by default (since this conflicts with the use of
\f[C]\-f\ bv*+ba\f[]).
If needed, this feature must be enabled using
\f[C]\-\-audio\-multistreams\f[] and \f[C]\-\-video\-multistreams\f[].
You can also use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ multistreams\f[] to enable
both
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-no\-abort\-on\-error\f[] is enabled by default.
Use \f[C]\-\-abort\-on\-error\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ abort\-on\-error\f[] to abort on errors
instead
.IP \[bu] 2
When writing metadata files such as thumbnails, description or infojson,
the same information (if available) is also written for playlists.
Use \f[C]\-\-no\-write\-playlist\-metafiles\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-playlist\-metafiles\f[] to not write these
files
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-add\-metadata\f[] attaches the \f[C]infojson\f[] to
\f[C]mkv\f[] files in addition to writing the metadata when used with
\f[C]\-\-write\-info\-json\f[].
Use \f[C]\-\-no\-embed\-info\-json\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-attach\-info\-json\f[] to revert this
.IP \[bu] 2
Some metadata are embedded into different fields when using
\f[C]\-\-add\-metadata\f[] as compared to youtube\-dl.
Most notably, \f[C]comment\f[] field contains the \f[C]webpage_url\f[]
and \f[C]synopsis\f[] contains the \f[C]description\f[].
You can use \f[C]\-\-parse\-metadata\f[] (#modifying-metadata) to modify
this to your liking or use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ embed\-metadata\f[]
to revert this
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]playlist_index\f[] behaves differently when used with options like
\f[C]\-\-playlist\-reverse\f[] and \f[C]\-\-playlist\-items\f[].
See #302 (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/302) for details.
You can use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ playlist\-index\f[] if you want to
keep the earlier behavior
.IP \[bu] 2
The output of \f[C]\-F\f[] is listed in a new format.
Use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ list\-formats\f[] to revert this
.IP \[bu] 2
All \f[I]experiences\f[] of a funimation episode are considered as a
single video.
This behavior breaks existing archives.
Use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ seperate\-video\-versions\f[] to extract
information from only the default player
.IP \[bu] 2
Youtube live chat (if available) is considered as a subtitle.
Use \f[C]\-\-sub\-langs\ all,\-live_chat\f[] to download all subtitles
except live chat.
You can also use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-live\-chat\f[] to prevent
live chat from downloading
.IP \[bu] 2
Youtube channel URLs are automatically redirected to \f[C]/video\f[].
Append a \f[C]/featured\f[] to the URL to download only the videos in
the home page.
If the channel does not have a videos tab, we try to download the
equivalent \f[C]UU\f[] playlist instead.
For all other tabs, if the channel does not show the requested tab, an
error will be raised.
Also, \f[C]/live\f[] URLs raise an error if there are no live videos
instead of silently downloading the entire channel.
You may use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-youtube\-channel\-redirect\f[]
to revert all these redirections
.IP \[bu] 2
Unavailable videos are also listed for youtube playlists.
Use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-youtube\-unavailable\-videos\f[] to
remove this
.IP \[bu] 2
If \f[C]ffmpeg\f[] is used as the downloader, the downloading and
merging of formats happen in a single step when possible.
Use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-direct\-merge\f[] to revert this
.IP \[bu] 2
Thumbnail embedding in \f[C]mp4\f[] is done with mutagen if possible.
Use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ embed\-thumbnail\-atomicparsley\f[] to
force the use of AtomicParsley instead
.IP \[bu] 2
Some private fields such as filenames are removed by default from the
infojson.
Use \f[C]\-\-no\-clean\-infojson\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-clean\-infojson\f[] to revert this
.IP \[bu] 2
When \f[C]\-\-embed\-subs\f[] and \f[C]\-\-write\-subs\f[] are used
together, the subtitles are written to disk and also embedded in the
media file.
You can use just \f[C]\-\-embed\-subs\f[] to embed the subs and
automatically delete the separate file.
See #630
(comment) (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/630#issuecomment-893659460)
for more info.
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-keep\-subs\f[] can be used to revert this
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]certifi\f[] will be used for SSL root certificates, if installed.
If you want to use system certificates (e.g.
self\-signed), use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ no\-certifi\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
youtube\-dl tries to remove some superfluous punctuations from
filenames.
While this can sometimes be helpful, it is often undesirable.
So yt\-dlp tries to keep the fields in the filenames as close to their
original values as possible.
You can use \f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ filename\-sanitization\f[] to
revert to youtube\-dl\[aq]s behavior
.PP
For ease of use, a few more compat options are available:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ all\f[]: Use all compat options (Do NOT use)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ youtube\-dl\f[]: Same as
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ all,\-multistreams\f[]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ youtube\-dlc\f[]: Same as
\f[C]\-\-compat\-options\ all,\-no\-live\-chat,\-no\-youtube\-channel\-redirect\f[]
.SH DEPRECATED OPTIONS
.PP
These are all the deprecated options and the current alternative to
achieve the same effect
.SS Almost redundant options
.PP
While these options are almost the same as their new counterparts, there
are some differences that prevents them being redundant
